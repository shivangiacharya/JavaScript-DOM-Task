    <h2>Hightlight the Text</h2>
    <h1>“The Night Train at Deoli” by Ruskin Bond</h1>
    <p id="demo1">Ruskin Bond used to spend his summer at his grandmother’s house in Dehradun.  While taking the train, he always had to pass through a small station called Deoli.  No one used to get down at the station and nothing happened there.  Until one day he sees a girl selling fruit and he is unable to forget her. What Is Great About It: Ruskin Bond is a writer who can communicate deep feelings in a simple way.  This story is about our attachment to strangers and why we cherish (value or appreciate deeply) them even though we do not meet them ever again.</p>
